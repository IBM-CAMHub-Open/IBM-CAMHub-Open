** Sample response file for IBM DB2
** --------------------------------
** To select features and settings to install, uncomment the corresponding
** keywords and specify values for those keywords.  You do not need to select
** features if you select the TYPICAL or COMPACT installation options.
**
** Comments are made by placing either an asterisk (*) or a hash symbol (#) at
** the start of a line, or by placing ** or ## after the start of a line to
** comment out the rest of that line.
** All keywords that are currently uncommented (not preceded by * or #) are
** mandatory and must be assigned values for the installation to continue.
** All other keywords are optional. If optional keywords are not specified,
** the installation will proceed using default values. Lines that start out
** with two asterisks are documentation and should not be enabled.
**
** For more information on creating or configuring an ESE instance with the
** DB2 pureScale Feature, see "Installing the
** IBM DB2 pureScale feature for DB2 Server Edition
** using a response file" in the DB2 Information Center.

** General Options
** ---------------

** Only one product can be specified for the following PROD keyword. Specifying
** multiple products in an installation is not supported.
PROD                      = DB2_SERVER_EDITION

** The FILE keyword determines the base installation path. If you specify a
** path that does not yet have this product, this will install a new copy.  If
** you specify a path that has this product, this will be considered an
** existing installation intended to install additional functionality.	This is
** a mandatory keyword for root installation. Remove this keyword for non-root
** installation. If not removed, its value must be $HOME/sqllib where $HOME
** represents the HOME directory of the non-root user ID that owns the non-root
** installation.
FILE                      = /opt/ibm/db2/V<%= @VERSION %>

** Modify the value of the following LIC_AGREEMENT keyword to indicate that you
** have read and agreed to the license agreement file in the db2/license
** directory on the CD.
LIC_AGREEMENT             = ACCEPT         ** ACCEPT or DECLINE

** If an interactive type is set, db2setup will prompt for CD locations and
** give feedback as to progress, otherwise nothing will be displayed until the
** installation is complete.
*INTERACTIVE              = NONE            ** NONE, YES, MACHINE

** The PACKAGE_LOCATION keyword is used only when the NLPACK is not available
** and any national languages are to be installed. This keyword specifies the
** location of the NLPACK.
*PACKAGE_LOCATION         =                 ** Any valid path

** The CONFIG_ONLY keyword is used to specify that the response file is being
** used for creating or configuring an instance, and nothing is to be
** installed. This keyword must be set to YES if a response file is used with
** db2isetup.
*CONFIG_ONLY              =                 ** YES or NO

** INSTALL_TYPE keyword is used to select the installation type. If you specify
** a TYPICAL or a COMPACT install type, no COMP keywords are required. In this
** case the installer will select the appropriate components for you.  All COMP
** keywords are ignored by the installer unless the INSTALL_TYPE is set  to
** CUSTOM. If you select the CUSTOM install type, then ensure that you enable
** all of the COMP keywords that are required for your database environment.
**
** Note: The install type is not related to the language selection.
** ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

** (Valid for non-root upgrade only) Upgrade Older Release
** -------------------------------------------------------
** Specify whether you want to upgrade any previous versions of the product.
** Specifying this keyword will remove any previous version and upgrade any
** settings to the new installation.  Be aware that during upgrade of the
** current copy, only the product specified in the response file will be

** IBM DB2 pureScale Feature Host Information
** ------------------------------------------
** Specify the hosts to which the DB2 product is to be installed. This section
** must always list the installation initiating host. Do no specify any
** keywords in this section if you are not installing the IBM DB2 pureScale
** Feature. Ensure that password-less ssh root access is available on all hosts
** and between all hosts.

** The HOST keyword is used to specify a host identifier for one set of host
** keys. This keyword is mandatory if you are installing the IBM DB2 pureScale
** Feature.
*HOST                     = host1           ** char(14)  no spaces

** Use the HOSTNAME keyword with the host identifier prefix to identify the
** name of the host. A host can be a physical machine or LPAR, on which a DB2
** member or a cluster caching facility will run. If an alias or IP address is
** provided, the installer will attempt to convert it to a canonical hostname
** prior to instance creation. The host name must be a unique host name across
** the network. The following formats are accepted: long name (for example,
** host1.ibm.com), short name (for example, host1), IP address (IPv4:
** xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx). This keyword is mandatory if you have specified the HOST
** keyword.
*host1.HOSTNAME           =                 ** char(255)  no spaces

** The CLUSTER_INTERCONNECT_NETNAME keyword is used to specify the name of a
** high speed interconnect name that corresponds to a high speed adapter name.
** Refer to the DB2 Information Center for valid types of high speed adapters.
** This keyword is mandatory if you have specified the HOST keyword.
*host1.CLUSTER_INTERCONNECT_NETNAME =       ** char(255)  no spaces


*HOST                     = host2           ** char(14)  no spaces
